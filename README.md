# Dr. Z

## Driver drowsiness and distraction prevention system

Driving on a long dark road, tired from too many hours behind the 
wheel, Zeke sped through night. His blinks lasted longer, his head
nodded, his awareness faded.

Zeke crashed into a bridge and died. Now we know him as Dr. Z,
the zombie inspiration of our project.
